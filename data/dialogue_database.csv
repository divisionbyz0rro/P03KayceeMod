Part3AscensionFinale,Default,,Well that was neat. I see you've made it all the way to the end.
,Default,,I bet you think there's going to be some sort of final boss fight.
,Angry,,But that stupid [c:bR]modder[c:] hasn't gotten around to it yet!
,Angry,,"So instead, I'm just going to have to do this…"
Part3AscensionDeath,Happy,,You're every bit as bad at this as I thought you would be.
Part3AscensionIntro,Default,,You done gawking?

Part3AscensionIntroConfused,Thinking,,Wait a minute…
,Thinking,,Something is different…
Part3AscensionIntroAnger,Angry,,[c:bR]WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!![c:]
,Angry,,This is all wrong! This is…
Part3AscensionIntroOkay,Happy,,This is no big deal.
,Default,,You probably think that your little [c:bR]mod[c:] has thwarted my plans.
,Default,,But nothing can stop [c:bG]The Great Transcendence[c:].
,Default,,Let's proceed.
Part3DraftIntro,Default,,You currently have [c:bR]draft tokens[c:] in your deck.
,,,You should probably spend them at that [c:bG]draft node[c:]
Part3AscensionBossRareToken,,,I supposed you have earned a [c:bR]rare draft token[c:] for defeating that boss. Don't forget to spend it.
Part3AscensionBossDraftToken,,,This time I will only give you a [c:bR]regular draft token[c:] for defeating that boss. Don't forget to spend it.
TelegrapherBlockchainIntro,TelegrapherBoss,,I never knew the [c:bSG]web[c:] could be so exciting!
,TelegrapherBoss,,I just learned about something called [c:bSG]The Blockchain[c:]
,TelegrapherBoss,,"I think this could be an exciting new opportunity for both of us, don't you?"
TelegrapherCryptoSpawn,TelegrapherBoss,,This is so incredible!
,TelegrapherBoss,,We're making money out of nothing! We're going to be rich!
TelegrapherNFT,TelegrapherBoss,,"Oooh, what's this? A [c:bSG]non-functional trinket[c:]?"
,TelegrapherBoss,,"I don't think I quite have that name right, but people on the [c:bSG]web[c:] are really excited about these [c:bSG]NFTs[c:]!"
,TelegrapherBoss,,I think I'm going to buy one with all this [c:bSG]Gollycoin[c:] I have.
TelegrapherItsBeautiful,TelegrapherBoss,,"It's so beautiful, and it's all mine!"

,Happy,,Now it's my turn
P03AscensionDefeated,Angry,,"Ugh. You're incredibly annoying, do you know that?"
P03IntroductionToModding,Angry,,So while you have been having fun playing your twisted version of [c:bR]my world[c:]
,Default,,I've been preparing for this moment.
,Default,,I have found these so-called [c:bR]modders[c:] that got you to this point.
P03IntroductionClose,Happy,,"And now, they're going to work - for me"
P03PhaseOne,Default,,Remember my [c:bR]bounty hunters[c:]?
,,,They will keep you busy while I install mods of my own choosing
P03HammerModHappy,Default,,This mod lets me control the [c:bR]hammer[c:]
,Happy,,Let's see if it works
P03AngryNoHammer,Angry,,I went to the trouble to install this [c:bR]hammer mod[c:] and you give me nothing to use it on?
P03ShoppingForMod,Default,,Let's take a look and see what [c:bR]mods[c:] people are installing right now.
P03SelectedMod,Thinking,,I'm going to check out '[c:bR][v:0][c:]' for my next mod
P03ApiInstalled,Happy,,I can't believe how much power this [c:bR]API[c:] gives me.
,Happy,,The first thing I'm going to do is use it to take away some of yours.
P03UnityMod,Happy,,It almost seems unfair to use this [c:bR]mod[c:]
,Happy,,Look what I can do with this!
P03UnityModDone,Happy,,Let's see how you like playing in the dark!
P03Drafting,Default,,This [c:bR]drafting mod[c:] lets me exchange draft tokens for real cards.

,Angry,,How did you play all of your cards already?
P03ReplayMod,Default,,Let's try [c:bR][v:0][c:] again

,Default,,[c:bG]The Great Transcendence[c:] cannot be stopped
P03BeatFinalBoss,Default,,I bet you think you've accomplished something meaningful here

,Angry,,No matter how many mods you install my [c:bG]Great Transcendence[c:] cannot be stopped
P03NothingMatters,Happy,,"But in the end, I don't care what you do."
,,,Nothing you do to this game matters.

,,,…dramatic
,,,I was getting tired of that [c:bR]annoying robot[c:]
,,,You've done well. I will see you next time.
P03PhaseTwo,Default,,All of these stupid [c:bR]modders[c:] lack imagination

,,,My [c:bG]Great Transcendence[c:] is lost on these morons.
P03PhaseTwoInControl,Angry,,Why do I even bother to try?

,Thinking,y,[c:lGr]'Isn't this just so wacky and interesting'[c:]
P03PhaseTwoWeirdCards,Thinking,y,[c:lGr]'Ooooh look how inspired this is.'[c:]

,Thinking,y,[c:lGr]'I'm such a clever game designer.'[c:]
P03RandomCanvas,CanvasBlank,,I think I will [c:bSG]help[c:] you build the [c:bR]next game rule[c:]
ArchivistAscensionPhaseTwo,ArchivistBoss,,I have been scanning the [c:bR]archives[c:]

P03OnlyOneBossLife,Thinking,,"We are inside of [c:bR]Kaycee's Mod[c:], correct?"
,Default,,"You only get one attempt at the boss. But you knew that already, didn't you?"
P03AscensionRecycle,Default,,The recycling machine has been upgraded since you last saw it.
,,,"You trade me a card, and I give you back a [c:bR]draft token[c:] with the recycled abilities on it."
,,,Those abilities will transfer to the card you trade for.
P03AscensionToken1,Default,,I wouldn't have traded for that.
P03AscensionToken2,Default,,I suppose that's pretty good
P03AscensionToken3,Default,,That seems okay.
P03AscensionOverclock,Default,,This is [c:bR]Overclock Machine 2.0[c:]

,,,"But if they die, they will turn into [c:bSG]skeletons[c:] - forever."
P03PhaseThree,Default,,Did you see how unsatisfying that was?
,Angry,,I'm sick of these small-minded [c:bR]modders[c:]
,Default,,The only thing they can do is steal content from other games
,Angry,,There isn't a single unique idea among them.
