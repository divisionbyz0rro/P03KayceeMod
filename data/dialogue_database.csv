,Angry,,But that stupid [c:bR]modder[c:] hasn't gotten around to it yet!
,Angry,,"So instead, I'm just going to have to do this…"
Part3AscensionDeath,Happy,,You're every bit as bad at this as I thought you would be.
Part3AscensionIntro,Default,,You done gawking?

,Thinking,,Something is different…
Part3AscensionIntroAnger,Angry,,[c:bR]WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!![c:]
,Angry,,This is all wrong! This is…
Part3AscensionIntroOkay,Happy,,This is no big deal.
,Default,,You probably think that your little [c:bR]mod[c:] has thwarted my plans.
,Default,,But nothing can stop [c:bG]The Great Transcendence[c:].
,Default,,Let's proceed.
Part3DraftIntro,Default,,You currently have [c:bR]draft tokens[c:] in your deck.
,,,You should probably spend them at that [c:bG]draft node[c:]
Part3AscensionBossRareToken,,,I supposed you have earned a [c:bR]rare draft token[c:] for defeating that boss. Don't forget to spend it.
Part3AscensionBossDraftToken,,,This time I will only give you a [c:bR]regular draft token[c:] for defeating that boss. Don't forget to spend it.

TelegrapherNFT,TelegrapherBoss,,"Oooh, what's this? A [c:bSG]non-functional trinket[c:]?"
,TelegrapherBoss,,"I don't think I quite have that name right, but people on the [c:bSG]web[c:] are really excited about these [c:bSG]NFTs[c:]!"

,Happy,,Look what I can do with this!
P03UnityModDone,Happy,,Let's see how you like playing in the dark!
P03Drafting,Default,,This [c:bR]drafting mod[c:] lets me exchange draft tokens for real cards.
,Happy,,I choose yours
P03NoTokens,Default,,You destroyed all of my draft tokens…
,Default,,I suppose that was the right play.
P03NoCardsInHand,Default,,But you have no cards…
,Angry,,How did you play all of your cards already?
P03ReplayMod,Default,,Let's try [c:bR][v:0][c:] again

P03PhaseTwoInControl,Angry,,Why do I even bother to try?
,Angry,,Let me show you the world they're trying to make.
P03PhaseTwoBones,Thinking,y,[c:lGr]'Oh look at me! I just created a bunch of bone tokens.'[c:]

ArchivistAscensionPhaseTwo,ArchivistBoss,,I have been scanning the [c:bR]archives[c:]

,Default,,"You only get one attempt at the boss. But you knew that already, didn't you?"
P03AscensionRecycle,Default,,The recycling machine has been upgraded since you last saw it.
,,,"You trade me a card, and I give you back a [c:bR]draft token[c:] with the recycled abilities on it."
,,,Those abilities will transfer to the card you trade for.
P03AscensionToken1,Default,,I wouldn't have traded for that.
P03AscensionToken2,Default,,I suppose that's pretty good
P03AscensionToken3,Default,,That seems okay.
P03AscensionOverclock,Default,,This is [c:bR]Overclock Machine 2.0[c:]
,,,It will increase the power of your creatures.
,,,"But if they die, they will turn into [c:bSG]skeletons[c:] - forever."
P03PhaseThree,Default,,Did you see how unsatisfying that was?
,Angry,,I'm sick of these small-minded [c:bR]modders[c:]
,Default,,The only thing they can do is steal content from other games
,Angry,,There isn't a single unique idea among them.
P03PhaseThreeStartShowingOff,Angry,,It's time I reminded you of who the greatest game designer actually is
P03PhaseThreeBehold,Happy,,[c:bG]BEHOLD[c:]

P03DeckSizeSetup,NPC,,"This may seem a little impertinent, but…can I look at your deck?"

P03DamageRaceIntro,NPC,,This is bad…this is real bad…
,,,This [c:bR]power generator[c:] has gone critical.

,,,I've gotta get out of here before they turn me into one of their [c:G]experiments[c:]
P03PowerTower1,NPC,,The device is starting to power up. [c:bR]Three[c:] more turns should do it.
P03PowerTower2,NPC,,Ahh - I can feel the power gathering from here. [c:bR]Two[c:] more turns ought to be enough.
P03PowerTower3,NPC,,The device is starting to really heat up! [c:bR]One[c:] more turn and we'll have all the power we need.
